            ### Instructions:
            1. Upload an image containing a clear face view
            2. Select the desired voice for the speech
            3. Enter the text you want the person to speak
            4. Click 'Generate Lipsync' and wait for processing
            5. Download or preview the generated video

            ### Tips:
            - Use images with good lighting and clear face visibility
            - The face should be relatively front-facing
            - For best results, use high-quality images
            
            ### Supported Formats:
            - Supported image formats: JPG, PNG
            - The image should contain a single, clear face
            - The face should be well-lit and centered
